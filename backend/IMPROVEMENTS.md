# Model Improvements for Better MSE, RMSE, and MAE

## Summary of Enhancements

The code has been significantly improved to achieve better evaluation metrics. Here are the key improvements:

## 1. Enhanced Feature Engineering

### Additional Lag Features
- **Close_t-1, Close_t-2, Close_t-3**: Multiple lag features to capture more historical patterns
- Better temporal dependencies

### Moving Averages
- **MA_3, MA_5, MA_7**: Simple Moving Averages for trend detection
- **EMA_3, EMA_5**: Exponential Moving Averages for weighted recent data

### Volatility Features
- **Volatility_5, Volatility_10**: Rolling standard deviation to capture price volatility
- Helps model understand market uncertainty

### Price Range Features
- **Price_Range**: Absolute difference between High and Low
- **Price_Range_Pct**: Percentage difference for normalization
- **High_Low_Avg**: Average of High and Low prices

### Price Change Features
- **Open_Close_Diff**: Difference between Opening and Previous Close
- Captures overnight gaps

### Volume Features
- **Volume_MA_3, Volume_MA_5**: Moving averages of volume
- Helps identify trading patterns

### Technical Indicators
- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Momentum indicator
- Identifies overbought/oversold conditions

## 2. Feature Scaling
- **StandardScaler**: Normalizes all features to same scale
- Improves model convergence and performance
- Prevents features with larger ranges from dominating

## 3. Hyperparameter Optimization
- **GridSearchCV**: Automated search for best parameters
- Parameters tuned:
  - `n_estimators`: [200, 300]
  - `max_depth`: [15, 20]
  - `min_samples_split`: [2, 5]
  - `min_samples_leaf`: [1, 2]
  - `max_features`: ['sqrt', 'log2']
- 5-fold cross-validation for robust evaluation

## 4. Model Complexity
- Increased from 100 to 200-300 estimators
- Deeper trees (max_depth 15-20 vs 10)
- Better capacity to learn complex patterns

## Expected Improvements

### Before (Original Model):
- Simple features: 6 basic features
- No scaling
- Fixed hyperparameters
- Basic Random Forest

### After (Improved Model):
- Rich features: 22 engineered features
- StandardScaler normalization
- Optimized hyperparameters via GridSearch
- Enhanced Random Forest

### Expected Results:
- **Lower MSE**: Better fit to actual values
- **Lower RMSE**: Reduced average prediction error
- **Lower MAE**: More accurate predictions overall
- **Higher RÂ²**: Better explanation of variance

## How to Train the Model

```bash
cd backend
python3 train_model.py
```

This will:
1. Load and preprocess the dataset
2. Create all 22 engineered features
3. Scale features using StandardScaler
4. Perform GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization
5. Train the best model
6. Save both model and scaler
7. Display evaluation metrics

## Files Modified

1. **train_model.py**: Complete rewrite with advanced features
2. **main.py**: Updated to match new preprocessing pipeline
3. **Model files**: Will be regenerated with better performance

## Technical Details

The improvements leverage:
- Time series characteristics (lag, moving averages)
- Market indicators (RSI, volatility)
- Price dynamics (ranges, changes)
- Volume patterns (moving averages)
- Feature normalization (StandardScaler)
- Automated tuning (GridSearchCV)

These enhancements should significantly reduce MSE, RMSE, and MAE values.
